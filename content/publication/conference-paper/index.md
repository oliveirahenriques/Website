abstract: I propose the Heterogeneous Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag Realized Volatility,
  with Jumps and Leverage Effect (HQADL-RV-JL). The specification incorporates the
  main stylized volatility facts, falling into HAR model class under the Quantile Regression
  framework. This approach allows for the flexibility of autoregressive coefficients across
  the quantiles, where each regressor may have an impact on scale, location and shape of
  conditional response distribution. The model was estimated on an equally spaced grid
  spanning 91 quantile levels between 0.05 and 0.95, using S&P500 index high-frequency
  returns. The results shows that the estimates of continuous volatility components are highly
  significant across the quantile levels, considering the daily, weekly and monthly frequencies.
  Furthermore, the daily and weekly coefficients for the jumps and leverage components
  were significant for almost all quantile levels, highlighting not only the adequacy of both
  asymmetric effects concerning their adjustments to this semiparametric specification, but
  also its importance for future volatility of returns. Regarding its performance, the results
  suggests that median forecast of the propose model is as good as the conditional mean
  prediction of Corsi e Ren`o (2012) specification in the medium and long term. Lastly, it
  was also performed the volatility density forecast for the last four days of the sample. The
  distributional aspects of the predicted densities exhibit asymmetries to a certain degree,
  taking the form of a bimodal distribution.
