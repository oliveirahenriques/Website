abstract: The supply of electricity is a highly important service in the economy. It is a basic condition
  for agentâ€™s daily activities, which has implications on society level of welfare. From this
  perspective, this paper aims to estimate the impact of changes in income and prices on
  household demand for electricity in Brazil during 2004-2015. We use Vectors Autoregressive
  (VAR) and Cointegration tests to obtain prices and income elasticities. The results shows that,
  on average, consumers react positively to income increases, while positive changes in
  electricity service tariffs and electrical equipment prices have a negative impact on residential
  electricity consumption. Besides, the outcome suggests a highly inelastic demand in Brazil.
  Both changes in income and prices have low impact on the amount of electricity consumption.
  It has already been described in Brazilian publications, revealing the need for sectorial policies.
  Regulatory agencies should work on establishing optimal tariff policies, aiming a more efficient
  and accessible service to Brazilian citizens.
